## Preparing to work on the project

1. You'll need homebrew to start setting up some necessary programs, [download it here!](https://brew.sh/)

2. Next you'll need to install our package manager, yarn:
``` shell
brew install yarn
```

3. The editor of preference is VSCode. It comes with a lot of nice features to help with your development. [Get VSCode here](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

4. Run VSCode, we'll need to install some extensions to help out with development
In the left navigation bar of VSCode, click the fifth icon which looks like a square block completing a 2X2 block, this is the
extensions manager. From here, you want the two following extensions:
- Prettier - Code formatter
- TSLint

5. Pull this project

6. Open up the `frontend` folder in VSCode

7. Open up terminal and run the folowing commands within the `frontend` folder
``` shell
yarn install
yarn run
```

8. A browser window will open to `localhost:3000`. You are now ready to begin coding!

9. Make a new branch to track your changes
``` shell
git checkout -b <YOUR_BRANCH_NAME>
```
